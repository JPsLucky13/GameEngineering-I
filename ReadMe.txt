GamePlay:

A shooter game where you control the red character and can press A,S,W,D to move left,down,up and right respectively.

Press H to shoot a projectile towards the purple enemies to defeat them.

Kill enough enemies and the game automatically quits. You win!

Get hit by an enemy and the game quits as well. You lose!

IMPORTANT: Run Release mode because the speed values of the player character and monsters have been adjusted. Debug works but is very slow.

Thanks Joe!
